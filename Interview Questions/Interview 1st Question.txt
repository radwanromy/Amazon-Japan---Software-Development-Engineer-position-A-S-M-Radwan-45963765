/*Amazon contract with multiple delivery courier such as Sagawa, Yamato, DHL, USPS to deliver items to customer's house.
Each courier will have different capacity for delivery, so delivery date for same item can differ. For example, item A 
can be delivered tomorrow by Sagawa, while will be 2 days later by Yamato.
We want to offer best delivery for customers, so we need to choose best delivery courier for each item customer orders. 

Q: Given list of ordered items and delivery speed by each courier, find earlest date to complite all delivery.

For example, let's say customer orders item X, Y, Z. Each courier can deliver the items at following speed. 

* item X
    * courier A - 1 day ~
    * courier B - 2 day ~
    * courier C - 1 day ~
* item Y
    * courier A - 2 day ~
    * courier B - 2 day ~
    * courier C - 3 day ~
* item Z 
    * courier A - 3 day ~
    * courier B - 3 day ~
    * courier C - 2 day ~

Then, earliest date to complete is 2 days, as we can ask delivery as follows
  - item X to courier A -> deliver in 1 day
  - item Y to courier A -> deliver in 2 days
  - item Z to courier C -> delivered in 2 days
